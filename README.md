# Sentiment Analysis
## How it Works
This program creates a sentiment analysis tool using the streamlit library and the transformers library. The streamlit 
library is used to build a user interface for the tool, while the transformers library is used to load a pre-trained 
Natural Language Processing model and tokenizer for performing sentiment analysis on the input text.
